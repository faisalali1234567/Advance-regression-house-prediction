Detail END to END real-world kind of project has been done with detail steps

Steps for Machine - Learning
1. Import the data
2. Analyse the data ( info, describe, head)
3. Label Encoder
4. train_test_Split (done only when we don’t have the boolean kind of data)
5. Stratified sampling (General one) (binary data consists )
6. Histogram
7. Correlation
8. Scatterplot
9. Separating the label and the attributes
10. Creation of pipeline
1. Missing attribute
2. Standardization
11. Selecting the best model
12. Evaluating the model by RMSE
13. Better evaluation tech using - cross-validation
14. Saving the model
15. Testing the model on test data
1. RMSE value
16. Using the model
df.plot(lind = “scatter”, x = “LotFrontage” , y = “SalePrice”,alpha = 0.9)
